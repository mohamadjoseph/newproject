        <p>Why did that Ninja build a castle during a gunfight? Who turned that monkey into a block of ice?<br> What even is a Kircheis Shard, anyway?</p>
        <p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive doesn’t have that problem, though. CS:GO is two teams armed with guns,<br> going after one another. It’s one of the most accessible games in esports and that fact has helped it grow into <br>one of the cornerstones of the industry.</p>
        <p>But while the game itself is easy to digest, there is a lot to take in when it comes to the CS:GO pro scene,<br> its teams, its players and its tournament structures.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, it’s worth taking a deep dive into the game to discuss what it is, who its most influential<br> figures are and how you should approach it as a new fan.</p>
