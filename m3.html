            <p>You should also watch the professional match in order to better recognize the professional game. You can also imitate<br>the way they play but try to keep playing in your own way if it is more comfortable. If you are AWPer you may need<br> to watch the AWPer pro and how to refine them.</p>

            <h1>Knowledge of the Map</h1>
            <p>You should also play more than one folder more than just a map. Because if you follow the tournament, not just 1 map you will<br> play. You will also be more bored if you only play 1 map. You need to know when to use flashbang and smoke. You should also<br>know where to place the right when throwing smoke.</p>
